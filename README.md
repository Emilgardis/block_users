Block users | 
============================================

Block users on twitch using the Twitch API. Removes follow and blocks interaction. Can parse single users, one user and from a file. Can interpret user ids 

## Guide

Use [Follower list viewer by CommanderRoot](https://twitch-tools.rootonline.de/followerlist_viewer.php) to filter accounts.
(ps, you can also use their [follow remover](https://twitch-tools.rootonline.de/follower_remover.php), which is probably easier to use for some, it has built-in filters ðŸ™‚)

Save the filtered results as a file.

Generate a token with [Twitch Token Generator](https://twitchtokengenerator.com/?scope=user:read:blocked_users+user:manage:blocked_users&auth=auth_stay) (needs to have scopes `user:read:blocked_users` and `user:manage:blocked_users`)

[Download](https://github.com/Emilgardis/block_users/releases/latest) the application, and put the executable in the same folder as the file containing users to block.

```sh
cd <path to folder with executable and block list>
./block_users --access-token <token> --skip-comma --file <file> 
```

```text
